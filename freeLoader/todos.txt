TODO:

Implementation:
* Load config files in config file manager (DONE)
* write files to CSV in testdata (DONE)
* config loading for dyanmixel (DONE)
* config loading for loadcell   (DONE)
* Gantry Constructor / config loading (DONE)
* calculateCurrentPosition

-maybe add deadzone to config file?
-there are two values of alpha and beta, one for compressive and one for tensile,
    but our configfile only holds one and our dyna doesn't account for this,
    so I added them.
* NEED TO FIX CCW internal speed calculation
